### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a psychology researcher (consumer behaviors, learning, environmental decision) looking for transition opportunities in data science or ds mix with behavioral science. 

I am familiar with Python, including libraries in pandas, scipy, scikit-Learn, tensorflow (keras), nltk, gensim, re, matplotlib, seaborn, and os.  
I can also scrap web data with BeautifulSoup and selenium, conduct analyses/modeling in R and SPSS, write queries in SQL, and make cool visuals in Tableau.

Please check out my repositories here. Main techniques used in each project are included in the project name. Currently I am working on projects that can showcase my nlp skill sets.

### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a psychology researcher (consumer behaviors, learning, environmental decision) looking for transiion opportunities in data science. 

I am familiar with Python, including libraries in pandas, scipy, scikit-Learn, tensorflow (keras), nltk, gensim, re, matplotlib, seaborn, and os.  
I can also scrap web data with BeautifulSoup and selenium, conduct analyses/modeling in R and SPSS, and write queries in SQL.

Please check out my repositories here. Main techniques used in each project are included in the project name. Currently I am working on projects that can showcase my nlp skill sets.
